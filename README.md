# client-server1_NetworkProgramming_1

Implement  the server1 and client1 mentioned in The Definitive Guide to Linux Network Programming book on chapter 2..

Add more verbosity to both client and server so that they show who they are connecting to, what they are doing, and what information they are sending or receiving. Try to print the socket numbers assigned to them by the operating system too.
